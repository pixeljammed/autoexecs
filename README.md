    - Make sure console is enabled and a console key is enabled in settings

### development
- Clone this repository
- Replace the paths in autoexecs.json with paths locating your autoexec files
- If you have multiple **.cfg** files for a game include them all, similarly to how it's done for CS2 in the example file.
- Enjoy changing and modding your autoexecs!
- Each time you want to update your repository run the python grabber script which will copy your files to the repo.
- Realise you could have used symlinks.
- Cry because you wasted half an hour writing a python script.
- Stop crying because you realised you finally learnt how to use shutil.
